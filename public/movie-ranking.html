<h1>The best movies - Lea</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>I love the nostalgia and magic these movies bring me, takes me to another world.</p>

<h3>Racksaw ridge</h3>
<p>The emotions in this movie are too much, also to know that it is based on a true story.</p>

<h3>La vitta Ã¨ bella</h3>
<p>Again, emotional movie that is also funny, romantic and can be transfered to real life.</p>
